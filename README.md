## Notes
- Mobile Control - Use a gyro to face in a direction and tap to get information about what's in front of you
- Make clues/locks hum so they can be found
- puzzles
    - play animal noises, a lock has four animals, number of sounds is the code
    - Make actions make sounds in other areas (doors squeaking, locks clicking, etc)
        - Make some buttons toggle two different doors together, so you gotta press the right ones to get them all unlocked
    - Three buttons (assign to 1, 2, 3), which start playing ascending notes at different speeds. Hit the buttons at the correct time to hit the top note simultaneously. Or perhaps instead of different speeds, the three together play a scale when started at the right times.
    - Red light/green light - choose to move until the an audible drone moves onto you. Failing moves you back.
    - Maze/chase area - Follow a tone (louder forward)
    - Three/four identical buttons that need to be pressed in order. The button hums when it's its turn
